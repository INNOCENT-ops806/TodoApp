# Todo App

## Project Description
This is a task management application that allows users to:
- Add tasks with due dates
- Delete tasks
- View a pie chart showing the success rate by the number of hours remaining until midnight
- See the time remaining until midnight

- **Due Date Tracking:** Assign due dates to tasks to keep track of deadlines.
- **Success Rate Visualization:** View a pie chart representing the success rate based on the number of hours remaining until midnight.
